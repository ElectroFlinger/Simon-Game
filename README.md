# Simon Game

## Description

The Simon Game is a web-based memory game where players must repeat increasingly complex sequences of colors generated by the game. The game starts when the player presses any key, at which point the system will blink one of the four colors. The player must then click the colors in the same order to advance to the next level. With each successful replication of the pattern, the game becomes progressively more challenging by adding another color to the sequence.

1. Open the game in your web browser.
2. Press any key to start the game.
3. Observe the color sequence that the game displays.
4. Click the colors in the same order as displayed.
5. Successfully replicate the sequence to advance to the next level.
6. If you make a mistake, the game will end, and you can start again by pressing any key.
