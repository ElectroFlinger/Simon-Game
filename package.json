  "description": "The Simon Game is a web-based memory game where players must repeat increasingly complex sequences of colors generated by the game. The game starts when the player presses any key, at which point the system will blink one of the four colors. The player must then click the colors in the same order to advance to the next level. With each successful replication of the pattern, the game becomes progressively more challenging by adding another color to the sequence.",
